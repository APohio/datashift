##  DataShift 

Provides tools to shift data between Ruby, external applications, files and ActiveRecord.

### Features

Map Active Record models and associations to files, generate sample templates.

Import and Export ActiveRecord models through .xls or CSV  files, including
all associations and with configurable defaults.

Create, parse and use Excel/OpenOffice (.xls) documents dynamically from Ruby.

High level rake tasks provided for key features.

Easily extendable Loader functionality to deal with non trivial import cases, such
as complex association lookups.

Specific loaders and rake tasks provided out the box for Spree E-Commerce,  
enabling import/export of all data including Products with complex associations such as Options/Variants and Images.

Many example Spreadsheets provided, fully documented with comments for each column.


## Installation

Add gem 'datashift' to your Gemfile/bundle, or install the latest gem as usual :

    `gem install datashift`

To use :

    gem 'datashift'
    require 'datashift'

To pull the tasks in, add this call to your Rakefile :

     DataShift::load_tasks

N.B - To use the Excel loader, OLE and Excel are NOT required, however
JRuby is required, since it uses Java's Apache POI under the hood to process .xls files.

Guards are provided, and used internally, for mixed Ruby setups. Can be used like :

    if(DataShift::Guards::jruby? )
        ..do something with Excel
    else
        ..do something with CSV
    end

## Active Record - Import/Export

Provides high level rake tasks for importing data via ActiveRecord models into a DB,
 from various sources, currently csv or .xls files (Excel/Open Office)


    bundle exec rake datashift:import:excel model=BlogPost input=BlogPostImport.xls verbose=true 


The library can be easily extended with Loaders to deal with non trivial cases required to exchange data between
 such files and any active record supported database.

Spree loaders are an example, these illustrate over riding processing for specific columns with
complicated lookup requirements.

A core feature of DataShift is the MethodMapper, which provides features for collecting
reflection information from ActiveRecord models (all different associations, including join tables with many-to-many relationships).

A full picture of all possible operations on a class can be created very easily, for example ona  Blog model :

    MethodMapper.find_operators( Blog )

This then allows Import/Export to be achieved, by mapping the file's header and column data to MethodMapper's operators
(i.e. the model's attributes and associations).

Here we retrieve the method details for a column name from a file, "Blog Date"

    MethodMapper.find_method_detail( Blog, "Blog Date" )

Loaders can use this method lookup functionality, to find the correct association for a column heading,
and populate AR object with row data.

This means data can be mapped to any model without any further coding. Generators are also supplied to export
a models attributes and associations to files, thus providing template spreadsheets that any user can fill out.

MethodMapper also stores column type information so the raw file data can be provided as is,
and whenever possible, under the bonnet the data will be cast to correct DB type.

Here we show how a column name from a file, "Blog Date", can be mapped to Assign a stringified date, to the blog_date column, on a new Blog object :

    MethodMapper.find_method_detail( Blog, "Blog Date" ).assign( Blog.new, "Sat Jul 23 2011" )

Because it's based on reflection against the model, can build complex relationships between tables during import/export, 
and extending data files with new columns need not require any additional Ruby coding.

New columns can simply be added to the Excel/Open Office spreadsheet, or CSV file, setting the new
attribute or association name in the header row. 


The Loader attempts to handle various human read-able forms of column names.

For example, given an association on the model called, product_properties, will successfully load
from columns with headings such as 'product_properties', 'Product Properties', 'ProductProperties' 'product properties' etc

For has_many associations, either multiple columns can be used,
 or multiple values can be specified in a single column using suitable delimiters.

Modular - so complex associations/mappings that require non generic lookups, can be handled by extending the loader engine.

Original focus was on support for the Open Source Spree e-commerce project, so includes specific loaders and rake tasks
for loading Spree Products, and associated data such as Product Variants, and Images.

## Template Generation and Export

Template generation tasks can be used to export a model's definition as column headings to CSV or .xls.
These can be provided to developers or business users, as a template for data collection and then loading.

Export tasks can be used to export of a model's definition and any existing data stored in the database.

This data can be exported directly to CSV or Excel/OpenOffice spreadsheets.


## Example Spreadsheets
    
  A number of example Spreadsheets with headers and comments, can be found in the spec/fixtures directory.

  Extensive Spree samples - including .xls and csv versions for simple Products or complex Products with multiple
  taxons, variants properties etc - can be found in the spec/fixtures/spree subdirectory.

  Column headings contain comments with full descriptions and instructions on syntax. 


## Features

- *High level wrappers around applications including Excel and Word

  Quickly and easily access common enterprise applications through Ruby

  Wrapper around MS Excel File format, acheived via Apache POI under JRuby, so not restricted to Windows
  and Excel does not need to be installed.

  The required POI jars are already included.

- *Direct Excel export*

  Excel/OpenOffice spreadsheets are heavily used in many sectors, so direct support makes it
  easier and quicker to migrate your client's data into a Rails/ActiveRecord project.

  No need to save to CSV or map to YAML.
  
- *Semi-Smart Name Lookup*

  Includes helper classes that find and store details of all possible associations on an AR class.
  Given a user supplied name, attempts to find the requested association.

  Example usage, load from a file or spreadsheet where the column names are only
  an approximation of the actual associations, so given 'Product Properties' heading,
  finds real association 'product_properties' to send or call on the AR object

- *Associations*

  Can handle 'belongs_to, 'has_many' and 'has_one' associations, including assignment of multiple objects
  via either multiple columns, or via specially delimited entry in a single (column). See Details section.

  Supports delegated attributes.

- *Rake Tasks*

  High level Rake tasks are provided, only required to supply model class, and file location :

    jruby -S rake datashift:import:excel model=MusicTrack input=MyTrackListing.xls


- *Spree Rake Tasks*

  Specific Rake tasks are also provided for Spree loading - currently supports Product with associations,
  and Image loading.

    jruby -S rake datashift:spree:products input=C:\MyProducts.xls


  **Product loading from Excel files specifically requires JRuby (But not Excel or OLE)**.


- *Seamless Spree Image loading can be achieved by ensuring SKU or class Name features in Image filename.

  Lookup is performed either via the SKU being prepended to the image name, or by the image name being equal to the **name attribute** of the klass in question.

  Images can be attached to any class defined with a suitable association. The class to use can be configured in rake task via
  parameter klass=Xyz.

  In the Spree tasks, this defaults to Product, so attempts to attach Image to a Product via Product SKU or Name.
 
  Image loading **does not** specifically require JRuby

  A report is generated in the current working directory detailing any Images in the paths that could not be matched with a Product.

  rake  datashift:spree:images input=C:\images\product_images skip_if_no_assoc=true

  rake  datashift:spree:images input=C:\images\taxon_icons skip_if_no_assoc=true klass=Taxon

## Import to Active Record

### Associations

To perform a lookup for an associated model, the primary column(s) must be supplied, along with required select values for those columns.

A single association column can contain multiple name/value sets, in string form :

  column:lookup_key_1, lookup_key_2,...

So if our Project model has many Categories, we can supply a Category list, which is keyed on the column Category.reference with :

  |Categories|

  reference:category_001,category_002

During loading, a call to find_all_by_reference will be made, picking up the 2 categories with matching references,
 and our Project model will contain those two i.e project.categories = [category_002,category_003]

## Spree Suppprt

### OptionTypes & Variants

When loaded with the Spree specific tasks, spree specific over rides are supported, such as direct s
support for OptionTypes with values

Any 'Option Types' columns can contain the OptionType to associate with the Product, plus a selection of
appropriate OptionValues to go with that Type. 

For example, in a single column/row we could supply 2 OptionTypes (named, size & colour), with a selection values
(such as small, medium etc)

    'Option Types'
    size:small,medium,large|colour:red,white

If no such OptionType exists, e.g size, then a new one is created with the supplied name.

Next the OptionValues are also parsed, again if no such OptionValue exists, e.g small, then a new one is created with the supplied name.

Lastly a Variant is created on each OptionValue, with price and availaable dates being copied from Master.
Currently a unique SKU is created by adding an index to the master's sku.

TODO - Enable a hash of attributes to be supplied in association columns to enable more control over creation of associated objects.

### Properties

The properties to associate with this product.
Properties are for small snippets of text, shared across many products,
and are for display purposes only.

An optional display value can be supplied to supplement the displayed text.

As for all associations can contain multiple name/value sets in default form :

    Property:display_value|Property:display_value

Example - No values :
    manufacturer|standard

Example - Display  values :
    manufacturer:somebody else plc|standard:ISOBlah21

## TODO

  - Add direct Image loading to Spree  i.e should be able to specify just path in a column .. "/images/red-tshirt.jpg"

  - Smart sorting of column processing order ....

  - Does not currently ensure mandatory columns (for valid?) processed first.

  - Look at implementing import/export API using something like https://github.com/ianwhite/orm_adapter 
    rather than active record, so we can support additional ORMs

  - Create separate Spree extension to support import/export via the admin gui
